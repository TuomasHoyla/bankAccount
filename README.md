# bankAccount

**Design and implement traditional/old 14-character based Finnish bank account number class.**
The Implementation needs to have a “client end” which uses this newly created bank account number class in some way, for example:
- Dim sourceAccountNumber as new FinnishBankAccountNumber(”110335-1537”)
- Response.Write(sourceAccountNumber.getLongFormat())
